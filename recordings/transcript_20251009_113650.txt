 Hello Tia. Hello. How are you? I am good. What about you? I am also fine. What are you doing currently? Currently I am studying about some concepts of system design, direct news, redundancy and more. Okay. And what was your CGPN last semester?  My last semester's CGP was 9.8 and my overall CGP is around 9.2. Okay, that's great. And can you tell me about your latest project? My latest project is, I'm one of the three artists for my company and I'm just in my current job, I don't check. Okay, that's great, dear. It was nice talking to you.  I myself have gone mad.
