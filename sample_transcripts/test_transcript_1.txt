Alex: Morning, Jamie. Thanks for joining — I wanted to go over the new project we’re kicking off: Farm2Door.

Jamie: Morning, Alex! Sounds good. What’s the main goal for the app?

Alex: The idea is to connect local farmers directly with customers. Users should be able to browse nearby farms, view available produce, place orders, and choose delivery or pickup.

Jamie: Got it. So essentially an online marketplace for farm-fresh products.

Alex: Exactly. We’ll need features like farm profiles, product listings, a shopping cart, and a payment gateway — probably Stripe for transactions.

Jamie: Noted. What’s the expected timeline?

Alex: We’re targeting a stakeholder demo in three weeks, and ideally, a pilot launch in six weeks after that.

Jamie: That’s tight but doable. I’ll start by setting up the core app structure and database this week.

Alex: Perfect. Also, let’s keep the UI simple and clean — focus on usability over design flair for now.

Jamie: Agreed. I’ll prepare wireframes and share them by Friday for review.

Alex: Great. We’ll sync again next week to check progress. Thanks, Jamie — let’s make this a success.
