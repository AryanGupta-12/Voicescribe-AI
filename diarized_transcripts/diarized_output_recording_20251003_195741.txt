[2.1s - 4.9s] SPEAKER_01:  I'm joined by my fantastic co-host, Evan.
[5.8s - 7.9s] SPEAKER_01: Evan, how are you doing today?
[8.0s - 10.7s] SPEAKER_00: Hey, Erin, I'm doing great.
[11.0s - 13.3s] SPEAKER_00: Feeling energized and ready for today's topic.
[13.7s - 14.2s] SPEAKER_00: How about you?
[15.1s - 15.9s] SPEAKER_01: I'm doing well too.
[16.9s - 27.3s] SPEAKER_01: You know, I had this moment yesterday where I just sat down and thought, why does it feel like some people completely turn their lives around while others stay stuck in the same place?
[28.4s - 30.1s] SPEAKER_00: Oh, I've had that thought too.
[30.4s - 36.0s] SPEAKER_00:  You see someone go from struggling to successful, and you wonder, what's their secret?
[36.5s - 40.3s] SPEAKER_00: Are they just lucky, or is there something they're doing differently?
[40.4s - 41.6s] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[41.6s - 45.7s] SPEAKER_01: And then I started thinking about when I was learning English.
[46.8s - 48.4s] SPEAKER_01: At first, it felt impossible.
[49.2s - 51.2s] SPEAKER_01: So many words, so many rules.
[52.5s - 55.5s] SPEAKER_01: But then, little by little, things started making sense.
[56.5s - 57.7s] SPEAKER_00: That's so true.
[58.1s - 64.1s] SPEAKER_00:  When I first started learning, I kept thinking, if I just knew more words, I'd be fluent.
[65.0s - 67.6s] SPEAKER_00: But it wasn't just about vocabulary.
